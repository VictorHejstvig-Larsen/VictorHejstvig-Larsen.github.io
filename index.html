        <h2>How do Politicians Learn to Predict Voter Behaviour?</h2>
        <p>
            I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. in Political Science at Aarhus University. My research area is centered around democratic representation, where I'm focusing on politicians perceptions of voter attitudes. 
            My project focuses specifically on how politicians learn to predict voter reactions to policy.
